===== RULES =====

- units advance through stages; Untrained, Blooded, Veteran and so forth, working your way up, gaining rewards as you go. Different for infantry and vehicles.

- Astartes are specifically mentioned as getting the option to "inter" characters into dreadnoughts, with similar systems in place for other armies.

- Blood Angels players, as an example, will have to manage "the Black Rage" via a points-based system.

- Requisition points unlock upgrade stratagems from various codices.

- Unique relic weaponry - as an example, daemon weaponry will be available to some factions (such as Astartes), but will be unreliable / dangerous for some.

-  Requisition points can expand the size of your roster, but there are also standardised game sizes as an option - that way, one player can't take a huge advantage over another on to the tabletop.

-  "Blessings" - because one side has more experience / special abilities / skills, they have more Campaign Points. Difference is calculated, and the opposition (less experienced side) receives more Command Points as a boon.

-  Crusade vs. Matched Play - they wanted to make sure both sides could play one another. If one side is using a MP army at 2000pts, they just need to determine the Power Level vs. the Crusade player - they'll then play a Crusade mission.

-  An ambush mission will grant more experience for killing enemies - an excavation / area control mission will grant more experience for doing that.



===== MISC =====

- Digital copies of the rosters will be available online.

- Players will be "compelled" to create names for their units and characters. Easy identification, but encourages a huge degree of creativity for the players. Most codices moving forward will generally have name generators.

-  The company has invested, and will continue to invest, a huge amount of resources into Crusade; it's planned to be a permanent feature moving forward.
